Deployment
----------

Until now, just a converter/reader for aggregating data (not even persisted in a database yet) for CSV and RSS exist. See demo_app.rb for implementation details


To run, have ruby 1.9 installed and type:
```
$> gem install bundler
$> bundle install
$> ruby demo_app.rb
```

There you can see stuff on the console. Type ```!!!``` to quit.
